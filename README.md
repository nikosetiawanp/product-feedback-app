### What I learned

Since this is my first project using supabase, I learned a lot about Backend as a Service (BaaS). I also learned a lot about relational database design.

### Useful resources

- [react.dev/learn](https://react.dev/learn) - This helped me when I need to search something about react
- [supabasee.com/docs](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/initializing) - This helped me when I need to search something about supabase
